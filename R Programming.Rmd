# Pipes
The pipe, `%>%`, comes from the `magrittr` package by Stefan Milton Bache. Packages in the tidyverse load `%>%` for you automatically
```{r}
library(magrittr)
```
## Other tools from magrittr
- `%T>%` (“tee” pipe) works like `%>%` except that it returns the left-hand side instead of the right-hand side.
```{r}
rnorm(100) %>%
  matrix(ncol = 2) %>%
  plot() %>%
  str()
#>  NULL

rnorm(100) %>%
  matrix(ncol = 2) %T>%
  plot() %>%
  str()
#>  num [1:50, 1:2] -0.387 -0.785 -1.057 -0.796 -1.756 ...
```
- If you’re working with functions that don’t have a data frame based API
(i.e. you pass them individual vectors, not a data frame and expressions to be evaluated in the context of that data frame), you might find `%$%` useful. It “explodes” out the variables in a data frame so that you can refer to them explicitly. This is useful when working with many functions in base R:
```{r}
mtcars %$%
  cor(disp, mpg)
#> [1] -0.848
```
